### Assignment 2 â€“ Locations with the greatest decrease in delays

From the data stream, implement a stream processing application that will monitor the delay
of traffic -> where delays are fastest decreasing. Detect the locations where the most traffic 
"spikes" occur repeatedly.

Input: Stream
Output: GPS coordinates of the "fastest delay minimization" locations, dashboard map 
showing these locations
